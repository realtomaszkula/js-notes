Objects:
 ☐ use Object.setPrototypeOf to set prototype chain for two object literals
 ☐ use Object.assign to merge two objects into new one
     -> one obj must override property of second obj
     -> second obj must have prototype of another object
     -> add property to second object with enumerable false
 ☐ use Object.is to compare NaN to NaN, 0 to -0
 ☐ use Object.getOwnPropertySymbols and Object.getOwnPropertyNames
